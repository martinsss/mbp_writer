# mbp_writer
A project for converting highlights from text files to .mbp annotation files

# Completed:
- 010 editor template for reading any* .mbp file
- Script for creating highlights at specific text bytes. Works perfectly for .txt books as they include no formatting.

# To do:
- Figure out how MOBI files are formatted to align bytes
- A new readme (Explain the structures of .mbp and decompressed .mobi files)
